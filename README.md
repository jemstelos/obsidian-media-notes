## Create Media Note

Create media notes instantly from a Youtube page using the provided bookmarklet (instructions [here](https://obsidian-media-notes.netlify.app/)).

This lets you click a button in your browser bar and automatically create a note for the YouTube video you're watching while continuing playback from the current location.

You can turn any Obsidian note into a media note by using the `Add file property` command, then typing in `media_link` and pasting the URL.

## Media Controls

Setup hotkeys to allow you to control the playback of the media you're taking notes on without leaving your note.

Hotkeys can be setup however you like through the Hotkeys settings page.
Suggestion hotkeys for Mac users that mirror YouTube's hotkey layout:
⌃J - Jump Backward
⌃K - Play/Pause
⌃L - Jump Forward
⌃I - Insert Timestamp

## Inserting Timestamps

Timestamps can be inserted for the current time in the video with a hotkey.

Clicking links that have the timestamp format (`HH:MM:SS`) will jump the playback time for the note's media player to that timestamp.

## Settings

Customize the viewing and note-taking experience with settings:

-   Vertical/Horizontal Player Mode - this sets the default viewing behavior, you can still toggle the mode for any given note
-   Player Size
-   Progress Bar Visibility + Color
-   Timestamp offset - you typically want to make a note on a point that was made a few seconds in the past
-   Timestamp template - you may want to insert timestamps with a space at the end or the beginning, depending on your workflow

## Format

A media note is just a markdown note with a `media_link` [property](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Properties) that contains a supported URL format. For example:

```
---
media_link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFXWY8TqSWw
---

[02:01]() - A useful insight, ties to my thought that [[Connections are key to creativity.]]
```

Media notes display an embedded player fixed in the note pane, so that the note content can be scrolled while viewing the player.

Timestamps are inserted into the note as markdown links with a timestamp format:
`[3:05:53]()`

Clicking links that have the timestamp format (`HH:MM:SS`) will jump the playback time for the note's media player to that timestamp.
